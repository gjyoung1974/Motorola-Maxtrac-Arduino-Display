Add a display and a rotary encoder to Motorola Maxtrac Radios

Required Components:
- Maxtrac VHF or UHF
- Something like am Arduino Nano 328p controller
- Rotary encoder
- LCD 08 X 02 (8 characters x 2 lines)
- 3K, 4.7K, 8.2K, 10K resistors
- Fine gauge insulated hookup wire such as wire wrap wire

In the MODE CONFIGURATION menu it's recommended to erase all the channels (MODE) and to leave only one channel with receive and transmit PL of 91.5 Hz.
The transmit and receive frequencies are not important because they will be set by the new controller, and not the original Maxtrac circuitry.
